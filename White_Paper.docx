TerraStake Protocol White Paper
________________________________________
Abstract
The TerraStake Protocol is a comprehensive blockchain-based platform designed to facilitate decentralized staking, governance, and project funding through tokenized assets. Leveraging cutting-edge smart contract architecture, TerraStake integrates functionalities such as secure staking, token reward distribution, governance mechanisms, project management, and oracle-powered data feeds. This document outlines the architecture, key components, and operational principles of TerraStake, as defined by its Solidity contracts.

Introduction
TerraStake aims to empower users with decentralized finance tools that ensure transparency, scalability, and security. It supports:
1.	Tokenized Staking: A robust staking mechanism that incentivizes participation.
2.	Reward Distribution: Dynamic reward pools for liquidity providers and stakers.
3.	Governance: A DAO-driven framework for protocol upgrades and decision-making.
4.	Project Management: Ecosystem for managing and validating impactful projects.
5.	Chainlink Oracles: Ensuring reliable and real-time data inputs for decision-making.

Core Components
1. TerraStakeToken
Overview
The TerraStakeToken (TSTAKE) is the native ERC-20 compliant token of the protocol. It supports voting, staking, and governance functionalities.
Key Features
•	Minting and Burning: Controlled token supply with role-based minting and burning permissions.
•	Redistribution and Burn Rates: Configurable rates to burn tokens and redistribute portions of transactions.
•	Vesting: Schedules for token allocation and vesting with claimable functionalities.
Smart Contract Highlights
•	Implements ERC20VotesUpgradeable, enabling governance token voting.
•	Uses ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable and PausableUpgradeable for enhanced security.
•	Built with OpenZeppelin's upgradeable library.
Role-based Access Control
Roles such as MINTER_ROLE, GOVERNANCE_ROLE, and EMERGENCY_ROLE ensure a granular and secure operational hierarchy.

2. TerraStakeITO
Overview
TerraStakeITO facilitates initial token offerings with features for dynamic pricing, vesting schedules, and Uniswap integration for liquidity provisioning.
Key Features
•	Dynamic Pricing: Prices adjust linearly over the offering duration.
•	Vesting: Tokens sold during the ITO are subject to vesting schedules.
•	Liquidity Management: Seamless integration with Uniswap V3.
Smart Contract Highlights
•	Implements customizable constraints like minimum and maximum purchase limits.
•	Includes emergency features such as pausing and token recovery.
•	Provides direct liquidity provisioning through Uniswap's INonfungiblePositionManager.

4. TerraStakeRewards
Overview
A comprehensive reward distribution mechanism, TerraStakeRewards manages reward pools and their disbursement based on user contributions.
Key Features
•	Reward Pools: Configurable pools with multipliers, halving schedules, and limits.
•	User-centric Design: Tracks individual user rewards, pending claims, and pool participation.
•	Distribution Pause: Rewards distribution can be paused in emergency scenarios.
Smart Contract Highlights
•	Implements a tiered reward system using multipliers and configurable durations.
•	Integrates distribution mechanisms for batch and individual claims.
•	Supports reward pool draining and dynamic halving.
